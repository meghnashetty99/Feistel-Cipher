# Feistel-Cipher

## Introduction

The Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers. It divides the input data into two halves and processes them through multiple rounds of permutation and substitution. The Feistel structure allows for the encryption and decryption processes to be very similar, making it efficient and secure.
